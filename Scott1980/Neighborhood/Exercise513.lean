# Exercise 5.13 (Scott 1981, PRG-19, Lecture V) — a one-one pairing `num : N × N → N`

> Prove the existence of a one-one function `num : ℕ × ℕ → ℕ` such that
>
> * `num(0, 0) = 0`,
> * `num(n, m+1) = num(n+1, m) + 1`,
> * `num(n+1, 0) = num(0, n) + 1`.
>
> Draw a picture (an infinite matrix) for the function and find a closed form for its values.
> Use the function to prove the isomorphism of the domains `P N`, `P(N × N)`, `P N × P N`.

## The picture

Reading `n` down the rows and `m` across the columns, the three recurrences walk the **anti-diagonals**
`n + m = const`, climbing one step (`+1`) each move and jumping to the start of the next diagonal at
the left edge:

```
        m=0   m=1   m=2   m=3
n=0      0     2     5     9
n=1      1     4     8
n=2      3     7
n=3      6
```

## The closed form

On the anti-diagonal `s = n + m` the values run `T(s), T(s)+1, …, T(s)+s` where `T(s) = s(s+1)/2`
is the `s`-th triangular number; the offset within the diagonal is exactly `m`. Hence

  `num n m = (n + m) * (n + m + 1) / 2 + m`

— the **Cantor pairing function**. We take this as the definition (`num`), verify Scott's three
recurrences (`num_zero_zero`, `num_succ_right`, `num_succ_left`), and prove it is one-one
(`num_injective`). In fact it is a *bijection*: we build a choice-free inverse `unnum` (iterate the
diagonal walk `nextCell` from `(0,0)`) and package the bijection as `numEquiv : ℕ × ℕ ≃ ℕ`.

## The domain isomorphisms

Following Exercise 4.17, the power-set domain `P A` is modelled by the complete lattice `(Set A, ⊆)`.
Order-isomorphisms of these domains are then induced by bijections of the index types
(`setCongr`). Since `ℕ × ℕ ≃ ℕ` (via `numEquiv`) and `ℕ ⊕ ℕ ≃ ℕ` (Mathlib's
`Equiv.natSumNatEquivNat`), all three domains are isomorphic:

  `P N ≅ P(N × N)`            (`PN_orderIso_PNN`),
  `P N ≅ P N × P N`          (`PN_orderIso_prod`),
  `P(N × N) ≅ P N × P N`     (`PNN_orderIso_prod`).

Everything (including `numEquiv` and the order-isomorphisms) is **choice-free**
(`#print axioms ⊆ {propext, Quot.sound}`).
