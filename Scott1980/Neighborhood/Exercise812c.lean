# Exercise 8.12(c) (Scott 1981, PRG-19, Lecture VIII) — a general two-sided back-and-forth lemma

Following the 7-part plan recorded in `arxiv.md`/`HANDOFF.md`, this file works towards **Exercise
8.12(c)**: a new, general (non-effective) lemma that two countable, atomless neighbourhood systems,
each satisfying a mutual one-step extension property relative to the other, are order-isomorphic.

## A structural shortcut over `Theorem88.lean`'s one-sided embedding

`Theorem88.lean`'s back-and-forth (`exists_split`/`atomU`/`Yseq`) embeds an *arbitrary* countable
`D` into `U` by tracking a matching pair `(A, B)` where only the `U`-side `B` is kept a genuine
`U`-neighbourhood-or-∅ at every step (via `U_no_minimal`); the `D`-side atom `A` is *never* required
to be a `D`-neighbourhood — it is an uninterpreted Boolean combination of `D`'s own sets and their
*complements* (`Δ \ Xᵢ`), which need not lie in `D` at all. This asymmetry is exactly what makes a
one-sided *embedding* enough, but is also exactly what breaks for a genuine two-sided
*isomorphism*: to alternately refine **both** sides (sometimes splitting `D₀`'s atom via `D₀`'s own
no-minimal property, sometimes `D₁`'s), the side not currently being split still needs to remain a
genuine neighbourhood-or-∅ at every step, including right after being intersected/subtracted by an
enumerated neighbourhood from the *other* side.

**Key discovery**: both `U` and `V` are already *Boolean-closed* — closed not just under
consistent intersection (Definition 1.1(ii)) but under **set-difference** of any two of their own
neighbourhoods (`U_diff_mem`, `V_diff_mem` below), on top of their already-known closure under
finite union (`U_union_mem`/`V_union_mem`) and unconditional/positive intersection
(`U`'s `combineIntervals`, `V`'s `levelSet_inter`, both witness-free). `U`'s case is nearly free:
`IntervalPrimrec.lean`'s `diffLists`/`presentedIntervals_diffLists` (built for the *computable*
presentation, Exercise 7.22-style) already witnesses this unconditionally, so `U_diff_mem` is a
two-line corollary. `V`'s case is the bitmask arithmetic identity `a ^^^ (a &&& b)` = "`a` and not
`b`", mirroring `levelSet_inter`'s own `upsample`-then-`&&&` formula.

Boolean-closure means a **complement-relative-to-master is always mem-or-∅** (`X \ D.master`, or
rather `D.master \ X`, is a special case with `Y := D.master`), and hence *every finite Boolean
combination* of enumerated neighbourhoods and their complements (`genAtom`, `Theorem88.lean`'s own
notion) is *automatically* mem-or-∅ by a direct induction — no `Classical.choice`-driven splitting
needed to keep either side "in the family". This is the structural fact that will let the two-sided
construction alternate which side is intersected/subtracted (a free computation) against which side
is split via the *other* system's no-minimal property (the one place non-constructive choice
genuinely enters, exactly as in `Theorem88.lean`), symmetrically.

## Status

This file establishes:

1. The Boolean-closure prerequisites `U_diff_mem`/`V_diff_mem` (and `U_isPositive`/`V_isPositive`,
 `U_noMinimal`/`V_noMinimal` repackaging the existing `U_no_minimal`/`V_no_minimal`).
2. The generic definitions (`NeighborhoodSystem.NoMinimal`, `.DiffClosed`) the back-and-forth is
 stated over, plus `genAtom_mem_or_empty` (Boolean atoms are automatically mem-or-∅ — no choice
 needed) and its one-step building blocks `inter_mem_or_empty`/`diff_mem_or_empty`.
3. `exists_split'`/`SplitSpec'`/`splitChoice'`: `Theorem88.lean`'s `exists_split`/`SplitSpec`/
 `splitChoice`, generalized from the hardcoded target `U` to an abstract atomless `E`.
4. **`atomPair`/`atomPair_invariant`**: the interleaved two-sided atom construction and its core
 invariant (matched emptiness, mem-or-∅ on both sides at every depth). This is the technical heart
 of the two-sided back-and-forth — see the section docstring above `atomPair` for the construction.

**Not yet done** (tracked as 8.12(c)'s remaining work): pairwise disjointness of `atomPair` across
disagreeing sign sequences (needed for a `Yseq`-style closed form on *both* sides at once), the
resulting `Xseq`/`Yseq`-analogue transfer lemmas (subset/inter-empty/inter-eq, mirroring
`Theorem88.lean`'s `transfer_subset_iff`/`transfer_inter_eq_iff` but bidirectionally), and the final
assembly into `DomainIso D₀ D₁`. This remaining work is comparable in size to the rest of
`Theorem88.lean` (`Yseq` onward) plus `Theorem88a.lean`'s assembly, done twice (once per direction)
plus the interleaving glue — a substantial next increment, tracked in `HANDOFF.md`.

with `b`'s bits cleared". Mirrors `levelSet_inter`'s own `&&&`-formula; here `^^^` combines with
`&&&` instead, since `a &&& b` is always a "submask" of `a` (every set bit of `a &&& b` is already a

every non-empty neighbourhood splits into two disjoint, non-empty neighbourhood pieces whose union
recovers it. (Phrased with explicit `Nonempty` clauses, equivalent given `Y ∩ Z = ∅`/`Y ∪ Z = X` to
`U_no_minimal`/`V_no_minimal`'s own `Y ≠ X`/`Z ≠ X` phrasing, but directly what `exists_split'`

/-! ### `U` and `V` are Positive (Exercise 1.19) -/

/-- **`U` is Positive**: since `combineIntervals` presents *any* raw intersection of two presented
lists unconditionally, and `X ∩ Y ⊆ [0,1)` is automatic whenever `X ⊆ [0,1)`, only non-emptiness
can ever obstruct `U.mem (X ∩ Y)`. -/

The key structural payoff of Positivity + difference-closure: `Theorem88.lean`'s `genAtom`
(a finite Boolean combination of an enumerated family `Z 0, …, Z (n-1)` and their complements
relative to `M`) is *automatically* `D.mem`-or-`∅`, by a direct induction — no
`Classical.choice`-driven splitting is needed to keep it "in the family". This is what will let the
eventual two-sided back-and-forth alternate which side is refined by plain intersection/difference
(free) against which side is refined by the *other* system's `NoMinimal` property (the one place
genuine choice enters, exactly as in `Theorem88.lean`). -/

else changes. This is the piece that lets the eventual two-sided construction invoke the *same*

These, and their basic subset/disjointness properties, are stated fully generically (independent

they do not pick up that section's `include`d hypotheses (`hD₀pos`, `hXmem`, etc.) as spurious
extra arguments — `xStep`/`yStep` only ever need a *single* system's data (`D₁`/`hD₁nomin` for
`xStep`, `D₀`/`hD₀nomin` for `yStep`), never the full two-sided context. -/

side. The `.swap` puts the output back into `(α-side, β-side)` order, matching `atomPair`'s own

Needed by 8.12(c)(vi)(3)'s `YseqE_empty_or_mem`: `Theorem88.lean`'s own `U_union_mem`/
`U_iUnion_mem` (`Definition87.lean`) are proved directly from `U`'s presented-interval structure
(list `++`), which an abstract `E` does not have access to. But `IsPositive` + `DiffClosed` +
`sub_master`, entirely on their own, already force closure under finite union via the De Morgan
identity `X ∪ Y = M \ ((M \ X) ∩ (M \ Y))` (valid whenever `X, Y ⊆ M`) — `M \ X`/`M \ Y` are
mem-or-∅ by `DiffClosed`, their intersection is mem-or-∅ by `IsPositive`, and one more `DiffClosed`
application finishes it. This is genuinely new generic content (`U`/`V`'s own union-closure lemmas
never needed to be derived this way), not a transcription of anything in `Theorem88.lean`. -/

Fix `D₀ : NeighborhoodSystem α`, `D₁ : NeighborhoodSystem β`, each Positive, difference-closed and
atomless (`NoMinimal`), with enumerations `X : ℕ → Set α`, `Y : ℕ → Set β` covering `D₀.mem`/`D₁.mem`
respectively. `atomPair` tracks a matched pair `(A, B) : Set α × Set β`, refined by *two* sub-steps
per index `n`: an **`X`-step** (test `A` against `X n` directly — free by Boolean-closure — and
correspondingly split `B` via `D₁`'s `NoMinimal`, exactly `Theorem88.lean`'s `exists_split` with
`E := D₁`), followed by a **`Y`-step** (symmetrically: test the *new* `B` against `Y n` directly,
and split the *new* `A` via `D₀`'s `NoMinimal`, `E := D₀`). A sign sequence `δ : ℕ → Bool × Bool`
selects the `+`/`-` branch at each of the two sub-steps. -/

/-! ### Exercise 8.12(c)(vi)(4): recovering `X n` on `D₁`'s side directly from `atomPair`

**Correcting the original pre-plan.** The plan (`arxiv.md`/`HANDOFF.md`, written before any code)
anticipated a *bridge* identifying `atomPair`'s per-side trajectory with an instance of
`Exercise812cYseq.lean`'s single-family `atomE` (`E := D₁` for the `X`-sub-step, `E := D₀` for the
`Y`-sub-step). **This turns out to be false**, not just difficult: `atomE`'s testing family
`genAtom X Δ δ n` is a *free* Boolean combination (only ever intersected/subtracted directly,
never split), whereas `atomPair`'s `A`-component is *itself* choice-split at every `Y`-sub-step
(via `D₀.NoMinimal`) — so whenever `exists_split'`'s genuine-split case fires (generically), the
actual `A_n` is a *proper* subset of `genAtom X Δ δ₁ n` (`δ₁ k := (δ k).1`), with different
emptiness. Concretely: both `atomPair` components are "`atomE`-like" (choice-driven), so *neither*
is "`genAtom`-like" (free) — unlike `Theorem88.lean`'s one-sided case, where `D`'s side stayed free
by construction. `Exercise812cYseq.lean`'s apparatus therefore is **not** reused here (it remains
valid, reusable general theory for any genuinely one-sided abstract `E`, just not what this specific
bridge needs).

**The actual fix**, found by re-deriving `Yseq`'s "I-formula" argument directly against `atomPair`,
reusing only `atomPair_invariant`/`atomPair_congr`/`atomPair_disjoint` (already `Pass`, (iv)/(v))
and `xStep_snd_subset` (already `Pass`, (v)(2)) — no `atomE` involved: `XPseq n` unions, over all
depth-`n` histories, the `D₁`-piece obtained by the `X`-sub-step's "+" branch (the *half-step*
value, strictly before the following `Y`-sub-step further refines it). This is *simpler* than
`Yseq`'s own proof in one respect: since the branch is a literal argument (`true`) rather than
`δ n`'s own value, there is no need for `Theorem88.lean`'s `Function.update`-based "`δ2`" detour —
agreement below `n` alone suffices. -/

Symmetric to `XPseq` above, but genuinely harder: `yStep`'s own inputs (the *post*-`X`-sub-step
values `A1`/`B1`) already depend on `(δ n).1` itself, not just history strictly below `n` — unlike
`xStep`'s inputs (`atomPair δ n`), which depend only on history strictly below `n`. So `YPseq`'s
union needs an *extra* free `Bool` parameter `bx` for position `n`'s `X`-sub-step bit ((b) below),
and relating an arbitrary such `bx` back to a concrete history's own bit needs a
`Function.update`-style bridge ((c) below, `xStep_spec_bit`, a drop-in generalization of
`xStep_spec` to an arbitrary bit rather than `δ n`'s own) before the "I-formula" itself ((d)) can

/-- **The "I-formula" for `YPseq`** (8.12(c)(vi)(4)(d)): the `D₀`-piece chosen by the `Y`-sub-step's
"+" branch (applied to the post-`X`-sub-step values at *any* history `δ`'s own bit `(δ n).1`) is
exactly the intersection of that post-`X`-sub-step `D₀`-value with `YPseq n`. Mirrors
`xStep_snd_eq_inter_XPseq`, but needs `xStep_spec_bit`'s bridge (unlike `XPseq`'s proof) to handle
the `⊇` direction's "history agrees below `n` but the union's bit differs from `(δ n).1`" case. -/
