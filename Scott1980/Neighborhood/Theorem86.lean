# Lecture VIII — Theorem 8.6 (Scott 1981, PRG-19): the `sub` combinator

**Theorem 8.6.** For any domain `E` define `sub : (E → E) → (E → E)` by the formula

`X sub(f) Z` iff `∃Y ∈ E. X ⊆ Y, f Y ⊆ Z`,

for all `X, Z ∈ E` and all `f : E → E`. Then the range of `sub` consists exactly of the finitary
projections on `E`, and moreover `sub` itself is a finitary projection on `(E → E)`. If `E` is
effectively given, then `sub` is computable.

## What is formalized here

Scott's formula for `sub(f)` is *literally* Proposition 8.2's `retractionOfSubsystem`, applied to
Theorem 8.5's subdomain `D = fixedNbhd f = {Y ∈ E ∣ Y f Y}` (which, recall, is a genuine subsystem
`D ◁ E` for *any* `f`, no hypotheses needed). This module formalizes the per-token map
`sub : ApproximableMap E E → ApproximableMap E E` and its order-theoretic content at that level,
**Theorem 8.6's clause 1 in full**:

* **`sub f ≤ f`** (`sub_le`) — Scott's "`X ⊆ Y, f Y ⊆ Z` always implies `X f Z`", a bare
  monotonicity calculation, valid for *any* `f`.
* **`sub` is idempotent, exactly: `sub (sub f) = sub f`** (`sub_sub`) — sharper than Scott's stated
  inclusion `sub(f) ⊆ sub(sub(f))`: unwinding `fixedNbhd (sub f)` shows it has *the same*
  neighbourhoods as `fixedNbhd f` (`Y ⊆ Y' ⊆ Y` forces `Y = Y'`), so `sub (sub f)` and `sub f` are
  built from literally the same subsystem and hence are equal, not just related by `≤`.
* **`sub` is monotone** (`sub_mono`) — immediate from `fixedNbhd`'s definition.
* **`range(sub) = finitary projections`, both directions** (`sub_eq_self_iff_isFinitaryProjection`):
  the easy half `sub f = f → IsFinitaryProjection f` (`isFinitaryProjection_of_sub_eq_self`) is
  immediate substitution into `Subsystem.isFinitaryProjection_retractionOfSubsystem`; the converse
  `IsFinitaryProjection f → sub f = f` (`sub_eq_self_of_isFinitaryProjection`) is now unblocked by
  Theorem 8.5's hard direction (`formula_of_isFinitaryProjection`): `sub_le` gives `⊇` for free, and
  `⊆` unwinds `X f Z` via `rel_iff_mem_principal` into `Z ∈ f(↑X)`, then rewrites via Theorem 8.5's
  formula into exactly `sub_rel`'s defining shape.
* **`sub f` is *always* a finitary projection**, for any `f` (`isFinitaryProjection_sub`) —
  `sub (sub f) = sub f` plus the above.

**Theorem 8.6's clause 2, in full (in `namespace Sub8_6`):** `sub` packaged as a genuine
`ApproximableMap (funSpace E E) (funSpace E E)` (`subApprox`), realizing Scott's remark that
"the correspondence `f ↦ sub(f)` preserves directed unions of `f`'s, thus `sub` is itself
approximable", and shown to be a **finitary projection** on `(E → E)`
(`isFinitaryProjection_subApprox`):
`subApprox` is built via Exercise 2.13's `ofContinuous`, using a new general domain-theory bridge
`continuous_of_monotone_iSupDirected` (`Exercise213.lean`: monotone + directed-sup-preserving ⟹
topologically continuous, proved directly from algebraicity) applied to `subFilter`, `sub`
transported along `funSpaceEquiv`. `subFilter`'s directed-sup-preservation
(`subFilter_iSupDirected`) needs no consistency argument at all: directed unions of *filters*
correspond, under `toApproxMap`, to the raw union of the underlying maps' *relations*
(`toApproxMap_rel_iSupDirected`, immediate from `mem_iSupDirected`), and `sub`'s formula is a
*positive* existential in `f`'s relation, hence commutes with such unions by pure logic
(`sub_toApproxMap_iSupDirected`). `IsRetraction subApprox`/`subApprox ≤ idMap` then drop out of
`sub_sub`/`sub_le` respectively (`isProjection_subApprox`).

**`IsFinitary subApprox`** (`isFinitary_subApprox`) turned out *not* to need the universal-domain
machinery after all: `finitaryProjectionSubsystemEquiv` upgrades Theorem 8.6(a)'s bijection
`f ↦ fixedNbhd f` / `D ↦ retractionOfSubsystem D` between `{f ∣ sub f = f}` and the subsystems
`{D ∣ D ◁ E}` into a genuine **order-isomorphism** (round trips `fixedNbhd_retractionOfSubsystem`
and `sub`'s own defining equation; order via `retractionOfSubsystem_rel`'s witness clause plus
`Subsystem.subsystem_iff_subset_of_common`). Composed with `Fix(subApprox) ≃o {f ∣ sub f = f}`
(`subApproxFixIso`, via `toApproxMap`/`toFilter`) and **Lecture VI's Proposition 6.11**
(`subsystemReprIso`: the subsystems of `E` already form a genuine domain), this gives the witness
for `IsFinitary subApprox` directly, with no new "domain of subsystems" construction needed.

**Not formalized (deferred):**

* **Clause 3 (computability)** — needs `E` effectively given (Def 7.1 machinery); a separate,
  not-yet-formalized prerequisite.

Everything proved here is **choice-free** (`#print axioms ⊆ {propext, Quot.sound}`), *except*
`isFinitary_subApprox`/`isFinitaryProjection_subApprox`, which pick up `Classical.choice` solely
through Proposition 6.11's `subsystemReprIso` (itself inheriting it from Exercise 2.22's `reprIso`,
the documented "for set theorists" exercise) — the same, already-accepted, provenance as every
other domain-representation result in this project (Ex 3.25/3.27, Prop 6.11 itself).

/-! ## Theorem 8.6, clause 2 (partial): `sub` is itself approximable, and a projection, on
`(E → E)`

Scott's remark: "the correspondence `f ↦ sub(f)` preserves directed unions of `f`'s, thus `sub`
is itself approximable". We realize this via Exercise 2.13 (`ofContinuous`): transported along
`funSpaceEquiv` to `subFilter : (funSpace E E).Element → (funSpace E E).Element`, `sub` is monotone
(`subFilter_mono`, from `sub_mono`) and preserves directed unions (`subFilter_iSupDirected`) — the
latter because `sub`'s defining formula (`sub_rel`) is a *positive* existential in `f`'s relation,
so it commutes with the raw union of relations that `toApproxMap` assigns to a directed union of
filters (`toApproxMap_rel_iSupDirected`, immediate from `mem_iSupDirected`), with no extra
consistency argument needed. `continuous_of_monotone_iSupDirected` then upgrades this to genuine
topological continuity, giving `subApprox := ofContinuous subFilter hc`.

`IsFinitary subApprox` (further below) needs no new "domain of subsystems" construction: it
composes `Fix(subApprox) ≃o {f ∣ sub f = f}` (`subApproxFixIso`) with the
`finitaryProjectionSubsystemEquiv`/`subsystemReprIso` route already available from Theorem 8.6(a)
and Lecture VI's Proposition 6.11.

**Not yet formalized:** the computability clause (Theorem 8.6's clause 3), which needs `E`
effectively given (Def 7.1 machinery), a separate prerequisite. -/
